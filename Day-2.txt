1. How git workflow works?
First make a github account and configure git on your system.
Make a folder and initialize it with git by git init.
Git Workflow->
Working Directory------------> index stage-----------> local repo--------->remote repo
	             git add -A		        git commit		git push

2. What're the different stages of a git project as commit, add?
There are 3 stages in a git project:
a. Modified: In this stage we do all the changes in our project locally.
b. Staged: Now we add the files by git add command and move to this stage.
c. Commit: Now we finally commit all the changes that we have done by git commit -m "message" command with a message.
At last we push our local directory to remote by git push command.

3. Is it possible to do a git commit before git add . if you have made any changes? Explain why?
No, it is not possible to do git commit before git add. It will show-
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
        modified:   file_name
Untracked files:
        file_name
no changes added to commit

* But if you have made changes to any previously committed files and do not add any new file then you can use
  git commit -a command to do it in one step.

4. Why is git diff used?
This command is used to track the difference between the different versions of a file.

5. Can we leave the commit message as blank?
Yes, we can leave the commit message as blank, but always doing a meaningful commit message is a good for you as well as for other developers.
Through this commit message you can come back to your previous versions of project easily.
