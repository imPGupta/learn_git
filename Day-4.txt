TASK-4
1. What do you mean by merge conflicts?
A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between the two commits.
Like, changes are made on the same line by both the developers or one deletes a file and other manipulates that file
or when both added a new file with same name.
Github provides a simpler where you can see the differences and resolve merge conflicts easily.

2. Can we have 200 different branches other than the master?
Yes, we can create as many branch as we want, there is no restrictions.

3. What's the difference between git branch -d and git branch - D?
git branch -d <branch_name> will delete a branch only if it has already pushed and merged with the remote branch.
git branch -D is used to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged.
