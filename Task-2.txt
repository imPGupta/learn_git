This repo shows how to begin with Git and Github.
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.
